# Go-train

this project aims to control my indoor bike trainer with a training and display the training as it would on Zwift or other platforms. Since I don't care about those virtual environments, but I'd like to watch a movie, the training should be shown as an overlay.

## Running the project

This is a `go 1.23.0` project

```bash
# After cloning
1. go mod tidy
2. go run main.go # A fake training will start here
```

## TODO

-  [ ] make the actually comminucate with my bike trainer which includes consuming data and feeding the trainer with information.
